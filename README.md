## Tools & Technologies
---
    - mysql - we used mysql2 in this instance so I used promises
    - express
    - sequalize
    - dotenv to hide personal data


## Installation
---
Step 1 - Clone the github repo

Step 2 - Enter your details in the EXAMPLE .env file and save as .env

Step 3 - Right click the server.js file and `Open in intergrated Terminal`, and run `npm i` to install dependancies

Step 4 - Enter `mysql -u <username> -p` in terminal (this will open sql shell)

Step 5 - Enter your password

Step 6 - Enter `source db/schema.sql`, once this has run enter `quit` to exit the shell

Step 7 - Enter `npm run seed` to seed the test data into the database

Step 8 - Enter `npm start` to open the server connection
